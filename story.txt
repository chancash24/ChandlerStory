This is the story all about how Chandler's life got turned upside down.
I would like everyone to sit right there,
and I will tell you how I became the Prince of Madison.

One day I was sitting in my computer science lecture taking notes on 
trees, when there was a loud crash outside of the lecture hall.
I looked behind me and I was shocked by what I saw.
 
You might not believe what I'm about to say, viewer discretion is advised.
I saw another construction project underway.
To be honest it's not a surprise, Madison always has construction somewhere.

However, constuction work always takes some time. Chandler wanted to help speed up the process. So, he used his "Computer Science" skills to make the project's complexity lesser and speed the process. And it was happily ever after.

Once the town realized that I used my awesome computer science skill to make it go faster, the mayor held a celebration in my honor.
All of this lead to finally becoming the Prince of Madison.
