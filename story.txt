This is the story all about how Chandler's life got turned upside down.
I would like everyone to sit right there,
and I will tell you how I became the Prince of Madison.

One day I was sitting in my computer science lecture taking notes on 
trees, when there was a loud crash outside of the lecture hall.
I looked behind me and I was shocked by what I saw.
 
You might not believe what I'm about to say, viewer discretion is advised.
I saw another construction project underway.
To be honest it's not a surprise, Madison always has construction somewhere.
